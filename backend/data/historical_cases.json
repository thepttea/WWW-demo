In a blog post, the company insisted the voice was not an imitation of Johansson but was recorded by another professional voice actress using her natural voice, whose name could not be disclosed for privacy reasons. CEO Sam Altman also issued a statement: 'The voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson's, and it was never intended to resemble hers. We cast the voice actor behind Sky's voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson. Out of respect for Ms. Johansson, we have paused using Sky's voice in our products. We are sorry to Ms. Johansson that we didn't communicate better.'",
