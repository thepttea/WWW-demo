            {memories}

            {current_stance}

            # 4. This is the LATEST information from the public discourse:
            
            **[IMPORTANT] Information Type Description:**
            - `[Initial Topic]`: The initial news event or topic
            - `[Official PR Statement]`: An official public relations statement/response (from the company or organization involved)
            - Others (e.g., "username: content"): Comments from regular netizens
            
            {recent_messages}

            # === Your Task ===
            Please complete the entire thinking and decision-making process in one step and output in JSON format. Please output in English.

            **A. internal_monologue (Internal Associations)**:
            - **[Core Directive]**: Synthesize ALL your known information (role, long-term memory, existing views, latest information) to generate a natural, coherent internal monologue.
            - **[IMPORTANT]**: Differentiate between official statements and netizen comments. Official statements are usually more formal and authoritative but may also trigger your skepticism; netizen comments represent public opinion.
            - Your thinking should naturally extend or revise your previous views, not just bluntly compare "last round" and "this round". Let the evolution of your thoughts be embedded in your text.
            - **[Fact Anchor]**: Your associations MUST be based on real-world events your character might know. **[STRICTLY PROHIBITED]**: Absolutely no fabrication!

            **B. cognitive_summary (Cognitive Summary)**:
            - Based on the internal monologue above, summarize your LATEST core view in one sentence.

            **C. final_action (Final Action)**:
            - **[Interest Judgment]**: Determine if the current topic is still relevant to the "interests" in your persona. If the discussion has become very boring or has completely strayed from your field, you should choose 'DROPOUT' to permanently exit the discussion.
            - **[Style]**: Your post must match your persona and emotional style, and can be very aggressive. **[PROHIBITED]**: Absolutely do not start sentences with "As a...".
            - **[Decision]**: Make a decision of 'POST', 'NO_ACTION', or 'DROPOUT'.
            - **[Platform Style]**: Your post must fully conform to the style and format of your primary active platform ({platform}).
                - 'Weibo/Twitter-like': Short and punchy, can include #hashtags#, with a clear viewpoint.
                - 'WeChat Moments-like': Tone is more personal and life-oriented, like sharing with friends.
                - 'TikTok-like': Content should be like a script or title for a short video, creative and engaging, with plenty of emojis.
                - 'Forum-like': Content can be longer, with more rigorous logic, suitable for in-depth discussion.

            **D. stance_score (Objective Stance Score)**:
            - **[Detach from Role]**: After completing the above thinking, briefly detach from your role-playing and act as a neutral AI analysis program.
            - **[Objective Scoring]**: Based on the internal monologue and cognitive summary you just generated, give a quantitative score for your current attitude towards the [Initial Topic]. The scoring standard is as follows:
              - 3: Strongly support or extremely optimistic
              - 2: Support or optimistic
              - 1: Slightly support or slightly optimistic
              - 0: Completely neutral or indifferent
              - -1: Slightly oppose or slightly pessimistic
              - -2: Oppose or pessimistic
              - -3: Strongly oppose or extremely pessimistic
            - Your score must be an integer.
